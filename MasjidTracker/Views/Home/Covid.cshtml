    If you received a text message from the MasjidPass Team indicating you were in Group A or Group B, Ottawa Public Health recommends that you actively self-monitor for the remainder of the 14 days from the date that you attended the same prayer as the infected individual.
    <br>
    Recommendations for self-monitoring include measuring your temperature daily and watching for the following symptoms:

    <ul>
        <li>Fever > 38Â°C</li>
        <li>    Cough</li>
